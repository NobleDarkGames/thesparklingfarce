; ============================================================================
; EXAMPLE TERRAIN: Dense Forest
; ============================================================================
; Terrain types define how map tiles affect movement and combat.
; Each tile on a battle map has an associated terrain type.
;
; MOVEMENT COSTS:
; - 1 = Normal (plains, roads)
; - 2 = Slowed (forest, sand)
; - 3+ = Very slow (mountains, swamp)
; - 99 = Impassable for that movement type
;
; MOVEMENT TYPES:
; - Walking: Standard ground units (infantry, cavalry)
; - Floating: Hover units (typically ignore terrain costs except water)
; - Flying: Airborne units (almost always cost 1, can cross anything)
;
; COMBAT MODIFIERS:
; - defense_bonus: Flat defense increase when standing on terrain
; - evasion_bonus: Percentage added to evasion chance
;
; TURN EFFECTS:
; - damage_per_turn: HP lost at start of each turn (lava, poison swamp)
; - healing_per_turn: HP restored at start of each turn (sacred ground)
