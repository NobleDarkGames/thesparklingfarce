; ============================================================================
; EXAMPLE CLASS: Warrior
; ============================================================================
; Classes define the role, stats, and equipment options for characters.
; A character must have a class assigned to function properly in battle.
;
; KEY CONCEPTS:
; - movement_range: How many tiles this class can move per turn
; - growth rates: Percentage chance (0-100) of gaining +1 to that stat on level up
; - equippable_*_types: Which weapon/armor categories this class can use
;
; IMPORTANT: Growth rates are percentages. A 70% growth means 70% chance
; to gain +1 in that stat each level. Shining Force typically uses:
; - 70-80%: Primary stat (e.g., Strength for Warriors)
; - 50-60%: Secondary stats
; - 30-40%: Tertiary stats
