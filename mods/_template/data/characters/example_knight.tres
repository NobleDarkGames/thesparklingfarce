; Characters are the actual units that appear in battles and your party.
; Each character has:
; - Base stats (starting values at level 1)
; - A class (determines growth, equipment, and abilities)
; - Optional portrait/sprite for visual representation
; - Biography and other metadata
;
; IMPORTANT: Characters require a valid class reference to function!
; Make sure your class file exists before referencing it here.
;
; UNIT CATEGORIES:
; - "player": Controllable party members
; - "enemy": AI-controlled opponents
; - "ally": AI-controlled friendlies (NPCs that help in battle)
; - "npc": Non-combatant characters
