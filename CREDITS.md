This project stands on the shoulders of giants:

### Shining Force Central
The community that kept Shining Force alive for decades. Their dedication to preserving and celebrating these games inspired this project.

### Shining Force ROM Hacks
Projects like **Shining Force Unleashed** and **Shining Force Alternate** proved there was demand for new Shining Force content and showed what dedicated fans could accomplish.

### Fan Tools
The various **Caravan stat tools** and editors created by the community inspired our approach to visual editing.
